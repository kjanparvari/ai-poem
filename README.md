# Poem Author Detection  

An artificial intelligence project to detect the author of a given Persian poem, identifying whether it was written by **Molana**, **Hafez**, or **Ferdowsi**. This project applies natural language processing techniques such as **unigram** and **bigram** modeling to analyze and classify poetic text.  

## Features  
- **Unigram and Bigram Models**: Extracts and analyzes word frequency patterns in poems.  
- **Author Classification**: Determines the most likely author based on linguistic and stylistic features.  
- **Language Processing**: Handles Persian text preprocessing and tokenization.  

## Technology Stack  
- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **Libraries**: NLTK, NumPy, Pandas  

## Purpose  
This project explores the use of natural language processing (NLP) techniques and AI methods for text classification, focusing on Persian poetry.
